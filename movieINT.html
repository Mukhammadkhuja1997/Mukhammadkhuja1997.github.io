<p><h3>Storyline</h3></p>
<p>In Paris, the aristocratic and intellectual Philippe is a quadriplegic millionaire who is </p>
<p>interviewing candidates for the position of his carer, with his red-haired secretary Magalie. </p>
<p>Out of the blue, the rude African Driss cuts the line of candidates and brings a document </p>
<p>from the Social Security and asks Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position </p>
<p>so he can receive his unemployment benefit. Philippe challenges Driss, offering him a trial </p>
<p>period of one month to gain experience helping him. Then Driss can decide whether he </p>
<p>would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the challenge and moves to the mansion, </p>
<p>changing the boring life of Phillipe and his employees.</p>
