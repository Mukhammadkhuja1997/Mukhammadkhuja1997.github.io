<font color="gray"><p><h1>Personality</h1></p>
<p>Timur is regarded as a military genius, and as a brilliant tactician with an uncanny ability to work within a highly fluid </p>
<p>political structure to win and maintain a loyal following of nomads during his rule in Central Asia. He was also considered </p>
<p>extraordinarily intelligent – not only intuitively but also intellectually.[8]:16 In Samarkand and his many travels, Timur, </p>
<p>under the guidance of distinguished scholars, was able to learn the Persian, Mongolian, and Turkish languages.[11]:9</p>
<p>(according to Ahmad ibn Arabshah, Timur didn't know Arabic)[32] More importantly, Timur was characterized as an </p>
<p>opportunist. Taking advantage of his Turco-Mongolian heritage, Timur frequently used either the Islamic religion or the </p>
<p>law and traditions of the Mongol Empire to achieve his military goals or domestic political aims.[11] Timur, mostly </p>
<p>considered a barbarian, in fact was a well learned king, and did enjoy the company of scholars —he was tolerant and </p>
<p>generous to them against his nature. Once Persian poet Hafez wrote a ghazal whose verse says if this Turk accept his homage:</p>
<p>—For the black mole on his cheek
I would give the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara</p>
<p>Timur upbraided him for this verse and said; "By the blows of my well tempered sword I have conquered the greater </p>
<p>part of the world to enlarge Samarkand and Bukhara, my capitals and residences; and you pitiful creature would </p>
<p>exchange these two cities for a mole". Hafez replied "O Sovereign of the world, it is by the state of similar generosity that </p>
<p>I have been reduced, as you see my present state of poverty." It is reported that the King was amazed by the witty </p>
<p>answer and the poet departed with magnificent gifts.[33]</p>
<p>Timur used Persian expressions in his conversations often, and his motto was the Persian phrase rāstī rustī (راستی رستی, </p>
<p>meaning "truth is safety" or "veritas salus").[32]</p></font>
